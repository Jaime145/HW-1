                        <br>
                        When I was 10, 14, and 16, I visited. My parents wanted to demonstrate my siblings the various kinds of 
                        creatures that live in our environment and the need for us to protect them, so that's why we went. Which 
                        is sort of the justification for my want to own a pet tiger, lol. <br> For once, I'm happy to see Belize conserving 
                        its wild species by establishing reserves and enacting legislation to do so. Belize has a lot to safeguard, but few 
                        people are aware of it.
