                    <h2>I traveled to Caracol because of a field trip that was required for our history class. We didn't have enough time to explore the entire region, 
                        and since it was a school trip, we had to write out our field trip paper so our instructor could grade us, which was tedious, 
                        but I did learn that Caracol was one of the largest and most important Maya cities at the time.
