                        <br>
                        <br> I went with my family to Xunantunich when I was about 8 or 9 years old. An outing as a family is something my parents want.
                        Being able to witness a Maya Temple for the first time made me happy. I'm missing out, according to what my pals have always said to me.
                        The moment I arrived there, I was awestruck by its beauty.<br> The forestry just awed me, and I learned so much about the area.
                        Did you know that they discovered a figure grasping at ropes while dancing? These ropes are known as birth ropes because
                         they hang from a house beam and are held by women when they give birth.
